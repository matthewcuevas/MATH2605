TO RUN:
Navigate to the folder containing the .class files using a terminal and to begin the program and start running individual methods, run:
    $ java Main.java


When a method asks for a path for a location file, please enter the .dat fileâ€™s full path. Entering a relative or a local path may not work and could cause the program to not find the .dat file.

TO VIEW WRITTEN PORTIONS FOR EACH PROBLEM:
Navigate to the appropriate folder for each problem. That is, Problem 1 for Problem 1, Problem 2 for Problem 2, and Problem 3 for Problem 3.
