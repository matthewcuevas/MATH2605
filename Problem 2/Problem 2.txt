Part I.

The average error for Jacobi Iteration was 2.256E-6.
The average error for Gauss-Seidel Iteration was 1.011E-6.

On average, Jacobi Iteration took 2.44 times as many iterations as Gauss-Seidel to converge on a vector within a tolerance of 5 decimal places.

(See Part_I_Data.ods for scatterplot)

With respect to the Spectral Radius of (S^-1)*T, in Jacobi Iteration, S = D and T = -L - U.

In Gauss-Seidel Iteration, S = L +D and T = -U.


Part II.

(See Part_II_Data.ods for scatterplot)

The Spectral Radius of this matrix is more than 1, therefore it never converges for either method.
