Written Problem 3 readme


For Part 3 there 3 Java files that are directly used
    Main.java
    Problems.java
    SolveUtil.java


Main.java contains the code that will run the program.

Problems.java contains code that will run specifically this section of the code. The method, problem_3(), runs all the required methods and creates the files containing all the necessary generated values. Details about what exactly goes on through the problem_3() method are given in Problem 3.docx. In that document, there are also the necessary graphs and thorough explanations about them.

SolveUtil.java contains the power_method() method that is called every time we need to use the power method.

The folder Prob 3 files contains the files that our program wrote out to. Details of the specific numbers that were written can be found in the word document. These files were compiled into Problem 3.xlsx for analysis and graph creation.

Problem 3.xlsx contains the data from the computer generated matrices and powermethod. It also contains the scatterplots from the data. More information on these graphs are also provided in the word document.

Problem 3 has been run previously to get the data needed to make the scatterplots by doing several things, including:
	a) matrices being created
	b) inverses being calculated
	c) calling the power method 600 times
	d) writing all the data values to separate files


All information asked to be printed should be shown in the word document.

Please see all the files in the Part 3 folder for all the answers requested. Thanks!
